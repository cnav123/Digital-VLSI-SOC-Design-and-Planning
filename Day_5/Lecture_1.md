# Lecture 1 :- Routing and Design Rule Check

## Introduction to Maze Routing and Lee Algorithmn

Its connecting two points in best posiible way, Less number of turns etc..,

Maze Routing - Lee's Algorithn [Lee 1961]

After Completing the routing and Connections are made in such a way that, for example

## DRC Checks

Design Rule Checks (DRC), For Example to create a parllel we need few rule

In a similar way there are many 1000, of rule that are need to maintain before the wiring is done


### lests a small DRC Error

Here there is wire short, can be resolved by adding a Layer

** Note :-  These rules comes from Lithographic techniques **

Later paractetics are Extracted
