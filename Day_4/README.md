# Day 4 :-  Pre-Layout timing analysis and Importance of Good Clock Tree

here We will be learning about some Important Concepts like 

1. Timing Modelling using delay tables

2. Timing analysis with idel clocks using openSTA

3. Clock tree synthesis TritonCTS and signal Integrity

4. Timing analysis with Real clcoks using openSTA
