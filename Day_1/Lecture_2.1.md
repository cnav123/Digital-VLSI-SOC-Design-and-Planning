# Lecture 2 :- SoC Design and OpenLANE

## Introduction to all components of Open-source digital asic Design

### Digital ASIC Design 

It requires mainly 3 components 
1. RTL IP's

2. EDA Tools

3. PDK DATA

By mixing all the above 3 we will get an ASIC Design

### Open Source Digital ASIC Design

For RTL Designs 

we can look in online etc..,


Here 130nm Technology is used
