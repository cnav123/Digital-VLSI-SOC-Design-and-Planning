# Digital-VLSI-SOC-Design-and-Planning


## Introduction
Welcome to the "Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning" course. 

In the Following Repo You will Get some clear fundamental and advanced concepts of integrated circuit design, guiding you through the crucial Place and Route (PnR) process to transform an RTL netlist into a final IC ready for tape-out. 

Here There is detailed hands-on experience in creating and characterizing standard cells, such as logic gates and flip-flops, which are the foundational building blocks of digital circuits.

Here there, is detailed walkthrough of the automated RTL2GDSII process, ensuring you understand how to convert high-level designs into a format ready for silicon fabrication. 

By engaging with Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, you'll be able to contribute to and benefit from the collective advancements in the field. This course also equips you with practical skills to plan and execute SoC design projects using the cutting-edge 130nm process node, positioning you at the forefront of modern IC design.
